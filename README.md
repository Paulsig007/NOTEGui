  ## Description
  I wanted an application that would allow to me to write notes that had a title. The app would allow me to save those notes, view previously made notes, and eventually delete those notes.

  ## Installation
  The user will have to run the npm i command once the code is cloned down from the repo in order to install the node modules. 
  
  ## Usage
  the server need to be up and running so the user would only need to run the server.js command. Once the server is running the user would then navigate to the http://localhost:3001 url and then use the app. The user can input a title for their note  and the text for the actual note itself. Then the user would click the save (floppy disk) button in order to save their note. They can click on the saved note in the left column, or they can click the trash can to delete the note. It's as simple as that.
